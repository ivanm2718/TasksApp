Steps to Complete the Homework

Step 1: Update the Task Structure

Modify the tasks array to include the new attributes (priority, dueDate).

Example:

const tasks = ref([
    {
        name: 'Learn Vue.js',
        user: 'user1',
        completed: false,
        priority: 'high',
        dueDate: '2023-12-01'
    },
    {
        name: 'Buy groceries',
        user: 'user2',
        completed: false,
        priority: 'medium',
        dueDate: '2023-11-15'
    }
]);

Step 2: Add Filtering by Priority

Add a dropdown to select the priority filter.
Filter tasks by priority status.

Step 3: Sort by due Date
Add a button to toggle sorting by due date (ascending).
